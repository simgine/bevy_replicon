/// Controls how often mutations are sent for an authorized client.

/// Associates entities with a priority number configurable by the user.
/// If the priority is not set, it defaults to 1.0.
///
/// During replication, we multiply the difference between the last acknowledged tick
/// and [`ServerTick`](super::server_tick::ServerTick) by the priority. If the result is
/// greater than or equal to 1.0, we send mutations for this entity.
///
/// This means the priority accumulates across server ticks until an entity is acknowledged,
/// at which point its priority is reset. As a result, even low-priority objects eventually
/// reach a high enough priority to be considered for replication.
///
/// For example, if the base priority is 0.5, mutations for an entity will be sent
/// no more often than once every 2 ticks. With the default priority of 1.0,
/// all unacknowledged mutations will be sent every tick.
///
/// All of this only affects mutations. For any component insertion or removal, the changes
/// will be sent using [`ServerChannel::Updates`](crate::shared::backend::channels::ServerChannel::Updates).
/// See its documentation for more details.
